## Deploying RBAC in New Cluster

As of version number 1.1.0-1.10.3, the Kubernetes DC/OS has allowed users to enable RBAC during provisioning. 

Since you must enable RBAC when you first provision the Kubernetes cluster, if you have an existing cluster, please delete it (we assume that the name of the cluster is kubernetes but if you used a different name you need to change the name in the flag “--app-id=NAME”)

```
dcos package uninstall --app-id=kubernetes kubernetes
```

Now install the cluster with RBAC enabled by going to the DC/OS catalog and choosing “RBAC” when you provision the cluster:

## How RBAC Works in Kubernetes

In Kubernetes there are two types of roles. Kubernetes Roles are used to give users or a Services authorization to Kubernetes namespaces. Meanwhile ClusterRoles is used to give users, most likely adminstrators, global authorization over the entire cluster. 

First let's see the roles (can also be seen in Dashboard)

```
kubectl get clusterroles
```

For an example of how the ClusterRole works, create a role binding for a line of business user on the fraud detection team who does not need admin rights but does need to view the cluster. First, let's use Kubernetes soft-multitentancy to create a namespace:

```
kubectl create namespace fraudteam
```

Then let's bind a users role to clusterole and that namespace

```
kubectl create rolebinding viewbind --clusterrole view --user fraudtm --namespace fraudteam
```

Let's view the roles for the namespace

```
kubectl get rolebindings --namespace fraudteam
```

## Authorization Rights

We can now test to determine the access rights of this user on the fraud team within their namespace. Let's see if they can get list of all the pods in the namespace:

```
kubectl auth can-i get pods --namespace fraudteam --as fraudtm
yes
```

However, since this user is from a line of business and had no admin rights in the role binding, they cannot create deployments:

```
kubectl auth can-i create deployments --namespace fraudteam --as fraudtm
no
```
