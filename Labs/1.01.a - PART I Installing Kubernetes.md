### Install Kubernetes kubectl Command Line

Install the Kubernetes command line by following instructions [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

**For Macs** with brew installed the command is

```
brew install kubectl
```

**For Ubuntu** the command is

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo touch /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list 
echo "deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kubectl
```

Confirm that kubectl is installed and in path /usr/local/bin (it will say it is not connected to dcos cluster yet which is ok)

```
kubectl version
```
